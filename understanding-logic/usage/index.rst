Usage and Installation
======================

The ``TFF`` models and tests can be run using the `latest
release <https://github.com/vprover/vampire/releases/tag/v4.9casc2024>`__
or ``master`` branch of the
`Vampire <https://github.com/vprover/vampire>`__ theorem prover.

If you want to run the ``THF`` models, you need to either install the
`LEO-III <https://github.com/leoprover/Leo-III>`__ theorem prover or
build the Vampire ``hol`` branch from source using these
`instructions <https://github.com/vprover/vampire/wiki/Source-Build-for-Users>`__.
Make sure to add the ``-DCMAKE_BUILD_HOL=ON`` flag.
